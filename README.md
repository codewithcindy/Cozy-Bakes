# Cozy Bakes

This project is my re-creation of [Colt Steele](https://www.youtube.com/c/ColtSteeleCode)'s Museum of Candy project from his Udemy course "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021".

The project was introduced immediately after the Bootstrap section as to practice responsive design using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) features and utilities.

### Bootstrap Features Used

- Navbar
- Flexbox columns (to distribute spacing for content)
- Order (to control display order of elements based on screen widths)
- Collapse (for the navbar on smaller screen widths)

---

### Other Resources Used

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

### Challenges I Faced

- Particularly for the navbar classes, there are so many classes I was getting confused

---

### What I Hope to Improve On Next Time

- Being more familiar with the Bootstrap docs
- Adding a backround color to the nav when it is collapsed
